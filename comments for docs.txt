		/**
		 *	Select all markers by a given selection-object.
		 *	If you want to find a marker that is defined as:
		 *	{
		 *		position: [0, 0],
		 *		userdefined: { identity: 'id_0815' },
		 *		hello: 'world'
		 *	}
		 *
		 * 	You can use one of following selection objects
		 *
		 * 	{
		 *		userdefined: { identity: 'id_0815' },
		 * 	}
		 *
		 * 	{
		 *		hello: 'world',
		 * 	}
		 *
		 *	This method will return all markers that define a subset of the given data-object.
		 *	If a marker doesn't contain all values of the given data-object it wont't be returned.
		 *	But be aware, if there are many markers this method can be very slow as it iterates over all markers.
		 *	If no data is given it returns all markers.
		 *	If data is a function it will be used to filter the markers.
		 *
		 *	@param		{Object|Function}	data	is a subset of all values for the returned markers (optional). If no data is given
		 *																		it returns all markers of a map.
		 *
		 *																		If data is a function this function will be used as a filter on the markerlist.
		 *																		The data-function should return a boolean-value and must be defined as 'function(marker, ...)'
		 *																		If the filter-function returns true for a given marker/any the marker will be pushed onto
		 *																		the results. A possible call can look like this:
		 *																			$('#map').goomaps('getmarkers', $.fn.goomaps.incircle, { center: [0, 0], radius: '10km' });
		 *																		With this you can define your own filter-functions or use the built-in-filter-functions like incircle.
		 *
		 *	@param		{Any}			The parameter 'any' will be used as the second parameter for a filter-function and is specific to the filter-function.
		 *											It's not required if:
		 *												- the filter-function don't need another parameter or
		 *												- there is no filter-function in the data-parameter
		 *
		 *	@returns	{Array}		Array of all markers that have defined all values of the given data-object. If there is no
		 *											matching marker it returns an empty array. If data is a filter-function this array will contain
		 *											all markers where the filter has returned true.
